      <h1>Why I’m Speaking</h1>
      <p>Because the truth matters. Because silence has allowed lies to live. Because my son, <strong>JayJay Taylor</strong>, deserves the full truth to be known.</p>
      <p>I’m speaking because Kayle Smith was the catalyst for JayJay’s murder – and because the lies told afterwards, including those spread by his mother, continue to insult JayJay’s memory and our grief.</p>
      <p>As a mother, I won’t let the last story of my child be a lie told by those who were never held accountable for their part.</p>

  <h2>The Catalyst: Kayle Smith</h2>
  <p>On the night of the fatal attack, Kayle Smith was seen speaking with Jack Costello...</p>
  <p>Witnesses confirmed that Kayle was present and involved in conversations just before...</p>

  <h2>The Night Everything Changed</h2>
  <p>JayJay was inside Esco Bar when Kayle Smith headbutted him in the face. Immediately after, Kayle walked over to Jack Costello — who was seated and speaking with another man — and whispered something in his ear.</p>
  <p>That whisper triggered what happened next. Jack suddenly launched at JayJay, biting his ear and carrying out a violent, unprovoked assault. It was fast, chaotic, and brutal.</p>
  <p>JayJay was later escorted out of the bar, vulnerable and bleeding. Moments later, he collapsed outside with a fatal neck wound. Despite emergency surgery, he died hours later.</p>

  <h2>The Witnesses Speak</h2>
  <p>In court, multiple witnesses described Kayle Smith’s choices that night. One said: <em>“Kayle walked off to speak to Jack. That’s when everything started.”</em></p>
  <p>Another confirmed seeing Kayle gesture in JayJay’s direction — just before the ambush.</p>

  <h2>What CCTV Revealed</h2>
  <p>CCTV footage captured Kayle Smith approaching Jack Costello, who was seated and talking to another man. Kayle leaned in and whispered something in Jack’s ear.</p>
  <p>Moments later, Jack launched toward JayJay — biting his ear and violently assaulting him. The CCTV also showed Kayle Smith leaving the scene straight after.</p>
  <p>These recordings directly challenged early claims of innocence and confirmed key moments that led up to the attack.</p>
