      <h1>Why I’m Speaking</h1>
      <p>Because the truth matters. Because silence has allowed lies to live. Because my son, <strong>JayJay Taylor</strong>, deserves the full truth to be known.</p>
      <p>I’m speaking because Kayle Smith was the catalyst for JayJay’s murder – and because the lies told afterwards, including those spread by his mother, continue to insult JayJay’s memory and our grief.</p>
      <p>As a mother, I won’t let the last story of my child be a lie told by those who were never held accountable for their part.</p>

  <h2>His Light Still Shines</h2>
  <p>JayJay’s spirit lives on through every act of truth, justice, and love. We remember him not just in sorrow, but in every moment of strength we draw from his memory.</p>
