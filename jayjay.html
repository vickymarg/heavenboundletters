      <h1>Why I’m Speaking</h1>
      <p>Because the truth matters. Because silence has allowed lies to live. Because my son, <strong>JayJay Taylor</strong>, deserves the full truth to be known.</p>
      <p>I’m speaking because Kayle Smith was the catalyst for JayJay’s murder – and because the lies told afterwards, including those spread by his mother, continue to insult JayJay’s memory and our grief.</p>
      <p>As a mother, I won’t let the last story of my child be a lie told by those who were never held accountable for their part.</p>

  <h2>JayJay’s Shine Section ✨</h2>
  <p>Every act of truth-telling, every step toward justice, and every moment of love we share is JayJay’s light shining through.</p>

  <h2>The Catalyst: Kayle Smith</h2>
  <p>On the night of the fatal attack, Kayle Smith was seen speaking with Jack Costello...</p>
  <p>Witnesses confirmed that Kayle was present and involved in conversations just before...</p>
</section>
 <section>
  <h2>The Night Everything Changed</h2>
  <p>JayJay was inside Esco Bar when Kayle Smith headbutted him in the face. Immediately after, Kayle walked over to Jack Costello — who was seated and speaking with another man — and whispered something in his ear.</p>
  <p>That whisper triggered what happened next. Jack suddenly launched at JayJay, biting his ear and carrying out a violent, unprovoked assault. It was fast, chaotic, and brutal.</p>
  <p>JayJay was later escorted out of the bar, vulnerable and bleeding. Moments later, he collapsed outside with a fatal neck wound. Despite emergency surgery, he died hours later.</p>

  <h2>The Catalyst: Kayle Smith</h2>
  <p>On the night of the fatal attack, Kayle Smith was seen speaking with Jack Costello.</p>
  <p>Witnesses confirmed Kayle was present and involved in conversations just before the moment that changed everything.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Night Everything Changed</h2>
  <p>JayJay was walking home through the town centre. A group had already gathered. CCTV later confirmed movement patterns and timing leading directly to the fatal event.</p>
  <p>Kayle Smith was witnessed circling back to speak to Jack Costello. Just moments later, JayJay was separated from his friends and attacked while isolated and unaware.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Witnesses Speak</h2>
  <p>In court, multiple witnesses described Kayle Smith’s choices that night. One said: <em>“Kayle walked off to speak to Jack. That’s when everything started.”</em></p>
  <p>Another confirmed seeing Kayle gesture in JayJay’s direction — just before the ambush.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What CCTV Revealed</h2>
  <p>CCTV showed Kayle Smith interacting with Jack Costello. One frame caught him walking ahead, pausing, turning back. Seconds later, JayJay was attacked.</p>
  <p>These images helped confirm timelines and challenged claims made in court.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Inconsistencies in Statements</h2>
  <p>Several individuals changed their versions over time. Initial reports clashed with later testimonies.</p>
  <p>Kayle at one point claimed he was walking home — a statement contradicted by witness accounts and CCTV.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why This Truth Matters</h2>
  <p>JayJay mattered. His voice, his laughter, his future. This isn’t about revenge — it’s about truth, accountability, and protecting others from silenced justice.</p>
