      <h1>Why I’m Speaking</h1>
      <p>Because the truth matters. Because silence has allowed lies to live. Because my son, <strong>JayJay Taylor</strong>, deserves the full truth to be known.</p>
      <p>I’m speaking because Kayle Smith was the catalyst for JayJay’s murder – and because the lies told afterwards, including those spread by his mother, continue to insult JayJay’s memory and our grief.</p>
      <p>As a mother, I won’t let the last story of my child be a lie told by those who were never held accountable for their part.</p>

  <h2>JayJay’s Shine Section ✨</h2>
  <p>Every act of truth-telling, every step toward justice, and every moment of love we share is JayJay’s light shining through.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Catalyst: Kayle Smith</h2>
  <p>On the night of the fatal attack, Kayle Smith was seen speaking with Jack Costello...</p>
  <p>Witnesses confirmed that Kayle was present and involved in conversations just before...</p>
</section>
    
<section>
  <h2>The Night Everything Changed</h2>
  <p>JayJay was walking through the town centre, unaware that a group had already gathered. CCTV later revealed movements, timings, and interactions leading up to the fatal moment.</p>
  <p>Multiple witnesses described Kayle Smith circling back to speak with Jack Costello — a crucial moment that appeared to trigger the events that followed.</p>
  <p>JayJay was ambushed and attacked in a location where he was separated from his friends, leaving him vulnerable and alone.</p>

<section>
  <h2>The Witnesses Speak</h2>
  <p>In court, witnesses described Kayle Smith making deliberate choices that night. One stated: <em>"Kayle walked off to speak to Jack. That’s when things started to shift."</em></p>
  <p>Another recalled seeing Kayle gesture toward JayJay’s direction — just moments before the ambush.</p>
  <p>These testimonies painted a pattern of behaviour that challenged earlier claims of innocence.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>What CCTV Revealed</h2>
  <p>The CCTV footage was pivotal. It captured key moments leading up to the attack — including Kayle Smith’s repeated interactions with Jack Costello and movements that placed him at the centre of the unfolding events.</p>
  <p>One frame showed Kayle walking ahead, pausing, then glancing back. Seconds later, JayJay was isolated and attacked.</p>
  <p>These recordings helped confirm timings and raised difficult questions about intent and involvement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Inconsistencies in Statements</h2>
  <p>Several individuals changed their versions of events over time. Initial accounts contradicted later testimonies, especially around who said what — and when.</p>
  <p>One moment Kayle claimed he was walking home, the next he admitted to waiting nearby. These shifting narratives added doubt and discomfort for those seeking clarity and justice.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why This Truth Matters</h2>
  <p>Because behind every statistic is a real son, a real mother, a real life stolen. JayJay mattered — his voice, his laughter, his future.</p>
  <p>This truth is not about revenge. It’s about ensuring that silence and misinformation don’t become the final story.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Light Beyond the Darkness</h2>
  <p>JayJay’s light shines not only in memory but in the strength it gives to others to speak up, seek truth, and hold on to love.</p>
  <p>Thank you for reading. This page will continue to grow — with facts, with love, and with the truth JayJay deserves.</p>
